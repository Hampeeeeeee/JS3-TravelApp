# React Travel App
A travel app that displays countries through restcountries. The user can then choose to search for a specific country, either within all countries or certain continents using the dropdown on the left side of the page.

The user can then choose to click the "more" button which displays details about their selected country, such as official name, region, capital, population, domain, languages and currency.

Other info, such as weather and a short description, is also available for the user.
